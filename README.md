TO DO LIST

Ben: Change img size in css to better fit divs.
Neal: Remove vertical gap in board grid. Map 8 arrows to appear around card in on each corner/edge.
Tim: Get images from api usable for cards. Randomly generate them when new card is called.

Ben "Spent a lot of time on async api calls that we don't need but glad I looked into it. Wrote a function that will push up the api imgs on the divs"
Neal "Created visual mockup, initial HTML/CSS for play area, player hand spaces and move counter. Will continue to refine."
Neal 8/8 "Fixed gutters between rows on game-board grid."
